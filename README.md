# Criminal-Identification-System-for-Hidden-Faces
This My Third Year EDI Project 

This Project focuses on the development of a Facial Detection & Recognition-based Criminal Identification System combining the Haar Cascade Classifier and LBPH Face Recognizer.
The system comprises three core phases: data collection, training, and real-time testing. It efficiently detects and recognizes faces, including those with glasses or masks,
achieving a notable accuracy rate of 92.56%. By integrating face detection and recognition, the project offers a reliable tool for law enforcement, capable of displaying criminal names and confidence scores.
This innovative approach enhances public safety, proving its practical value in real-world scenarios.
