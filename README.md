# Criminal-Identification-System-for-Hidden-Faces
This is My Third Year EDI Project 

Project Name:- Facial Detection & Recognition-Based Criminal Identification System

Problem Statement:- To create an efficient and reliable system for detecting and recognizing faces for criminal identification, addressing challenges like glasses, masks, and varying facial conditions.

How I Solved It:- Implemented the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and LBPH Face Recognizer for face recognition. The system was developed in three phases: data collection, training, and real-time testing, achieving a recognition accuracy of 92.56%.

Technology Used:- Haar Cascade, LBPH Face Recognizer, OpenCV, and Python, with capabilities to display criminal names and confidence scores for enhanced public safety.
